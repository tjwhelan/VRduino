## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
* Added `CompositionLayerManager.TryGetLayerId(CompositionLayer layer, out int layerId)` to get a layer's unique id instead of `GetInstanceID()` or `GetEntityID()`.

### Fixed
* Fixed `InteractableUIMirror` to support creating or duplicating them during runtime such as with prefabs or asset bundles.
* Fixed `CompositionLayersRuntimeSettings` so that the `Script` property is no longer modifiable from the inspector.
* Fixed `InteractableUIMirror` so cameras can be added at runtime without camera layer issues.
* Fixed `ScriptableSingleton` warning log when first launching a project with the composition layers package.

### Changed
* Changed `InteractactableUIMirror` Cameras so they are visible in the inspector
* Changed how CompositionLayerManager initializes `LayerInfo.Id` to use its own generated unique ids instead of `GetInstanceID()` or `GetEntityID()`.

## [2.3.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added
* Added Background Type option to the Composition Layer Splash Screen settings to allow using Passthrough as the background.

### Fixed
* Fixed `DefaultLayerData` so it no longer logs a warning related to the `SerializeReferenceAttribute` when you install this package for the first time.
